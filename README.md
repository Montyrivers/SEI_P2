Description:  To capture and display fascinating data from Nasa's API's returning interesting positional data and photographs

Objective: to create an immersive, well styled app purported to get viewers to become more interested in NASA's research and exploration.

Challenges:  The API calls I have made so far seem promising, but the way they are structured is challenging to unpack,or in the worst case some of the API targets have poor or dated documentation ie.  the JPL planet viewer has an HTML5 app but all the docs are still for Java.  I foresee myself breaking through the more simple API targets so I can move forward with displaying and styling them in as elegant a way as I can manage.

Current Component Hierarchy:
Router:
App---state to components:
------Epic
------Footer
------JPLViewer
------MarsRover
------SpacePhoto
services: nasa-api-- axios calls

API website:  https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#getting-started

MVP:  A well styled and animated page that loads and displays data smoothly.
POST MVP:  A seamlessly styled and animated page that loads and displays data smoothly, has more streamlined searching, better organization and maybe even a couple of style related easter eggs.
